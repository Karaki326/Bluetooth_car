ðŸš— Demonstrating Innovation at Lebanese International University ðŸš—

I'm thrilled to share my recent experience demonstrating a robotic car project at an event held at Lebanese International University. Under the supervision of Dr. Rabia Amrou, I showcased the capabilities of this robot, which integrates advanced distance detection and motor control to navigate its environment.

 About the Robotic Car:
ðŸ”¹ Functionality: The robot car is controlled via Bluetooth commands and can move forward, backward, turn left, right, and stop. It also adjusts its speed and direction based on distance measurements to avoid obstacles.
ðŸ”¹ Technology: 
 - Motors and Servo: Controlled by a combination of motor speed adjustments and a servo motor for direction.
 - Sensors: Uses ultrasonic sensors to measure distance and make decisions to stop or change speed to avoid collisions.
 - Communication: Operates through Bluetooth commands for remote control.

 Key Features:
- Bluetooth Control: Allows for wireless operation and command input.
- Distance Sensing: Utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and respond accordingly.
 - Adaptive Speed: Adjusts motor speed dynamically based on distance to obstacles.
- Auditory Alerts: Emits different tones to indicate proximity to obstacles.

 Demonstration Highlights:
- Interactive Session: Engaged with students and faculty, explaining the technical aspects and practical applications of the robot.
- Positive Feedback: Received encouraging responses and suggestions, highlighting the potential of such projects in educational and practical scenarios.

I am deeply grateful for the guidance and support from Dr. Rabia Amrou and the university's computer science department. This project represents a significant step in utilizing technology for innovative and educational purposes.
